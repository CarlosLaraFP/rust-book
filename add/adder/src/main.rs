    Notice that the workspace has only one Cargo.lock file at the top level, rather than having a
    Cargo.lock in each crateâ€™s directory. This ensures that all crates are using the same version
    of all dependencies. If we add the rand package to the adder/Cargo.toml and add_one/Cargo.toml
    files, Cargo will resolve both of those to one version of rand and record that in the one
    Cargo.lock. Making all crates in the workspace use the same dependencies means the crates
    will always be compatible with each other.
