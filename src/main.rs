/*
    By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it brings into the
    scope of every program. This set is called the prelude.

use std::io;
// use anyhow::anyhow; // Only use anyhow! macro if no default implementation is already provided
/*
    The logic behind the anyhow crate is that it provides its own error type.
    This type has pretty-printing properties and can easily be converted from other errors,
    like std::io::Error. It's easy to add anyhow to our project.
    All we have to do is place it as the return type of the main function.
    Because most error types can be converted to anyhow::Error, we can use ? syntax to remove
    the expect calls from our code. Also, note that we're using the anyhow! macro to produce an
    anyhow::Error on the fly that contains the provided error message.
    Now every panic message caused by an I/O error being returned from within our program will be displayed user-friendly.
