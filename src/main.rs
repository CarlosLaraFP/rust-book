/*
    The logic behind the anyhow crate is that it provides its own error type. This type has
    pretty-printing properties and can easily be converted from other errors, like std::io::Error.
    It's easy to add anyhow to our project. All we have to do is place it as the return type of the
    main function. Because most error types can be converted to anyhow::Error, we can use ? syntax
    to remove the expect calls from our code. Also, note that we can use the anyhow! macro to
    produce an anyhow::Error on the fly that contains the provided error message. Now every panic
    message caused by an I/O error being returned from within our program will be displayed user-friendly.
